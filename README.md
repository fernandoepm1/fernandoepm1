### :briefcase: Background

I'm a very passionate programmer with a background in electrical engineering, now with more then 3 years of experience working as a fullstack web developer mainly focused on Ruby on Rails and JavaScript.

### :zap: Active projects

I'm currently looking for new remote opportunities that are mainly focused on backend using the Ruby on Rails framework. I also have a lot of open-source projects in development, mainly for studying|learning purposes. Now focusing on JavaScript frameworks like ReactJS, React Native and Vue.js.

### :joystick: Fun facts

My favorite hobbies are gaming, running, table tennis, biking and swimming.
My favorite game of all time is Dark Souls, it really teachs you about learning from your mistakes and the ephemerality of life. I'm also really into RPG games, indie, strategy, puzzles and really old games from SNES/N64/GameBoy.
