### :briefcase: Background

I'm a very passionate programmer with a background in electrical engineering, now with almost 2 years of experience working as a fullstack web developer mainly focused on Ruby on Rails and JavaScript.

### :zap: Active projects

I'm currently working as a Software Developer at @agendakids, mainly focused on back-end tasks using the Ruby on Rails framework.
I also have a lot of open-source projects currently in development, a lot of those I'm using as practice to study new technologies, such as ReactJS, React Native and Vue.js.

### :joystick: Fun facts

My favorite hobbies are gaming, running, table tennis, biking and swimming.
My favorite game of all time is Dark Souls, it really teachs you about learning from your mistakes and the ephemerality of life. I'm also really into RPGs, indie games, strategy and RTS, puzzles and really old games from SNES/n64/GameBoy.
